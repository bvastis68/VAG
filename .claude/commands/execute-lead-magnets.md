# Execute Lead Magnets from Notion

Query the Notion Lead Magnet Pipeline database for items with status "Execute", then build the marketing assets for each one.

## Design System
Read these before building anything:
- lead-magnet-system/reference/conversion-landing-sample.html

## Notion Database Info
- **Data Source ID:** [YOUR NOTION DATA SOURCE ID]

---

## Pipeline:

### Step 1: Query Notion for "Execute" Items
Fetch the pipeline database and find all entries where Status = "Execute".

For each item, extract:
- Name, Topic, Slug, Format, Notion URL, Page ID

If no items have status "Execute", inform the user and stop.

### Step 2: Update Status to "In Progress"
For each item, immediately update its status to "In Progress".

### Step 3: Build Assets Based on Format

#### Format = "Notion" (default)
The deliverable is the Notion page. Build marketing assets only:
1. Research the topic (for landing page copy)
2. Build the landing page at website/lead-magnets/[slug].html
3. Write the delivery email at website/lead-magnets/[slug]-email.txt
   - Include the Notion URL as the deliverable link

#### Format = "PDF"
The deliverable is a downloadable PDF:
1. Read content from the linked Notion page
2. Research the topic (for landing page copy)
3. Build a PDF-formatted HTML at website/lead-magnets/[slug]-pdf.html
4. Build the landing page at website/lead-magnets/[slug].html
5. Generate the PDF via Puppeteer
6. Write the delivery email referencing the attached PDF

#### Format = "Both"
Follow the PDF pipeline, but the email references both the PDF and the Notion page link.

### Step 4: Update Notion
Set Status to "Complete" for each processed item.

### Step 5: Deploy
Stage all new files, commit, and push to deploy.

### Step 6: Summary
For each item: title, format, files created, and remind user to paste the email into their CRM automation.
